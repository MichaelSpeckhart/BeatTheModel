      <p>Let's define some basic terms: </p><br/>
        <div class='box'>Descriptive Statistics:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li>Mean, median, and mode: These help us understand where the "center" of our data is - the mean is the average, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most frequent value. </li>
            <li> Range, variance, and standard deviation: These tell us how spread out our data is - range is the difference between the highest and lowest values, while variance and standard deviation measure how far data points are from the mean.</li>
            <li> Frequency distributions: These show us how often each value or range of values occurs in our data.</li>
        </ul></div><br/><br/>

        <div class='box' float="right"> Probability: Who is most likely to win?
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li> Probability basics: Probability is the chance that something will happen; we use it to make predictions and understand uncertainty.</li>
            <li> Probability distributions: These describe how likely different outcomes are, like the chances of a team winning a game. </li>
            <li> Conditional probability: It's the probability of one event happening given that another event has occurred.</li>
        </ul></div><br/><br/>
        <li> Correlation and Causation: Does weather affect who is going to win? 
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li> Correlation vs. causation: Correlation means two things are related, but it doesn't mean one causes the other. Causation means one thing directly influences another.</li>
            <li> Scatterplots: These are like a visual way of checking for correlation, showing how two variables move together on a graph.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/></li>
        <li> Regression Analysis:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li> Linear regression: It helps us find a straight line that best fits the relationship between two variables, like how a team's record relates to their future performance.</li>
            <li> Multiple regression: This extends the idea to consider more than one factor, like a team's record, weather, and other variables that might affect game outcomes.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/> </li>
        <li>Hypothesis Testing:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li>Null and alternative hypotheses: This is a way to formally test if something is true or not. The null hypothesis is usually the "status quo," and the alternative is what you're trying to prove.</li>
            <li>Significance level and p-values: These tell us if the results of a test are likely due to chance or if they're meaningful.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/> </li>
        <li>Sample Size and Confidence Intervals:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li> Sample size: A bigger sample usually gives us more reliable results.</li>
            <li> Confidence intervals: They give us a range of values that our population parameter (e.g., team performance) is likely to fall within.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/> </li>
        <li> Model Evaluation:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li>Mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared: MSE measures how well our model predicts, and R-squared tells us how much of the variation in outcomes our model explains.</li>
            <li>Overfitting and underfitting: Overfitting is when a model is too complex and fits the data too closely, while underfitting means it's too simple and doesn't capture the relationship.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/></li>
        <li> Practical Applications:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li>Player performance analysis: Statistics help coaches and scouts evaluate player skills and potential.</li>
            <li>Drafting strategies: Teams use data to choose the best players in drafts.</li>
            <li>Odds calculation: In sports betting, statistics determine the odds of winning.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/></li>
        <li>Data Collection and Sources:
        <ul class='undo'>
            <li>Where to find data: You can get sports data from sources like websites, APIs, or databases.</li>
            <li>Data preprocessing: Cleaning data ensures it's accurate and ready for analysis.</li>
        </ul><br/><br/></li>
